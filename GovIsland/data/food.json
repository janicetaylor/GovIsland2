Whenever Water Taxi Beach is open, two restaurants, the Beach Grill and the Backstage Cafe, are serving 'respectfully priced' food and drink. On the menu: hamburgers, veggie burgers, hot dogs, kielbasa, knockwurst, vegan potato salad and ice cream.<P>The Backstage Cafe, inside the old ferry waiting room, offers 'Picnic Pouches' starting at $37. All food served at the Backstage Cafe is natural, grown locally, and is antibiotic and preservative free. The Backstage Cafe practices sustainable and environmentally friendly cooking, composting and care.",
